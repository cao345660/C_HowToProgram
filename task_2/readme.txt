task_216
Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, obtains them from
the user and prints their sum, product, difference, quotient and remainder

task_217
Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 4 on the same
line. Write the program using the following methods.
a) Using one printf statement with no conversion specifiers.
b) Using one printf statement with four conversion specifiers.
c) Using four printf statements.

task_218
Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, obtains the
numbers from the user, then prints the larger number followed by the words “is larger.” If the
numbers are equal, print the message “These numbers are equal.” Use only the single-selection
form of the if statement you learned in this chapter.

task_219
ÍWrite a program that inputs three different
integers from the keyboard, then prints the sum, the average, the product, the smallest and the largest
of these numbers. Use only the single-selection form of the if statement you learned in this chapter.
The screen dialogue should appear as follows:
Input three different integers: 13 27 34
Sum is 54
Average is 18
Product is 4914
Smallest is 13
Largest is 27

task_220
Write a program that reads in the radius
of a circle and prints the circle’s diameter, circumference and area. Use the constant value 3.14159
for ?. Perform each of these calculations inside the printf statement(s) and use the conversion specifier
%f. [Note: In this chapter, we’ve discussed only integer constants and variables. In Chapter 3
we’ll discuss floating-point numbers, i.e., values that can have decimal points.]

task_221
Write a program that prints the following shapes with asterisks.

task_223
Write a program that reads in three integers and then determines
and prints the largest and the smallest integers in the group. Use only the programming techniques
you have learned in this chapter.

task_224
Write a program that reads an integer and determines and prints whether
it’s odd or even. [Hint: Use the remainder operator. An even number is a multiple of two. Any multiple
of two leaves a remainder of zero when divided by 2.]

task_225
Print your initials in block letters down the page. Construct each block letter out of the letter
it represents, as shown below.

task_226
Write a program that reads in two integers and determines and prints whether
the first is a multiple of the second. [Hint: Use the remainder operator.]

task_227
Display the following checkerboard pattern with eight
printf statements and then display the same pattern with as few printf statements as possible.
* * * * * * * *
 * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
 * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
 * * * * * * * *

 * * * * * * * *

task_229
Here’s a peek ahead. In this chapter you learned about integers
and the type int. C can also represent uppercase letters, lowercase letters and a considerable
variety of special symbols. C uses small integers internally to represent each different character. The
set of characters a computer uses together with the corresponding integer representations for those
characters is called that computer’s character set. You can print the integer equivalent of uppercase
A, for example, by executing the statement
printf( "%d", 'A' );
Write a C program that prints the integer equivalents of some uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
digits and special symbols. As a minimum, determine the integer equivalents of the following:
ABCabc012$*+/ and the blank character.

task_230
Write a program that inputs one five-digit number, separates
the number into its individual digits and prints the digits separated from one another by three
spaces each. [Hint: Use combinations of integer division and the remainder operation.]

task_231
Using only the techniques you learned in this chapter, write
a program that calculates the squares and cubes of the numbers from 0 to 10 and uses tabs to print
the following table of values:
number square cube
0	0	0
1	1	1
2	4	8
3	9	27
4	16	64
5	25	125
6	36	216
7	49	343
8	64	512
9	81	729
10	100	1000
